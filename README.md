# TubeIT

> This is not my PNGTuber, it is simply one I downloaded for testing. Message me to remove it if it is your intellectual property

## Features
- Works on most image types - even though this is designed for PNGs (and we'd recommend that you use them) it does also work for JPEGs and BMPs!
- Customisable background - is your avatar mostly green, yet when you try to chroma key out the background you find your avatar goes as well? Well TubeIT allows you to customise the background color to your hearts content; meaning you can easily find a color that allows your avatar to be cleanly cut out
- Shake on talk - want to add some more flair? Well simply toggle the shake box and watch as your avatar shakes around the screen when you talk (This can be customised in settings)
- Mic Level - not sure how much your microphone is picking up? Well simply click start and watch as the audio level is displayed below.
- Adjustable input level - is your character not changing even though your mic is being picked up? Simply lower the input level to one where the character does change
- Stored settings - annoyed by software always losing your optimal settings? Well your settings are saved every time you adjust them! We also save your avatars for quick starting!

## Usage
- Install the latest TubeIT release
- Start the program
- Select your two pngs - one for when not talking, and one for when talking
- Click start
- Toggle fullscreen mode from the options tab
- Use in programs such as OBS or Streamlabs (Select Window Capture)

## Future Features
- Shake levels varying based on mic input levels

## Known Issues
- If the user has Asseto Corsa installed they will get a warning about 'TubeIT.pdb' - Clicking yes will open the TubeIT (and not open AC)
- When starting with saved avatars, they will load as small images; this can be fixed by clicking 'Start'
- Program softlocks if user attempts to start without loading any images
